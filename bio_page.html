                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>My name is David Vasek and i am currently a student at DigitalCrafts. I recently enrolled in a Full-stack developer bootcamp in hopes of starting a career in the tech world. I have always been interested in how things work/are created. Thats why technology has always been an interest of mine and i finally took the leap into this new field. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2019 in pursuit of a career in the medical field. As time passed while at UT, my passion for medicine started to disappear. I always choose the computer sciecne building to study and found myself watching the other students more than actually studying for my own classes. I soon befriended a few people who introduced me to all the different things involved in web development. Before I knew it, I was playing around with Python more than actually studying for the MCAT. </p>
